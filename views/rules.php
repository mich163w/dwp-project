  <p>
  Welcome to our photo-sharing site,
Where drinks are the stars, nothing to incite.
To enjoy, kindly follow these rules,
So together we can create some good vibes, no fools. <br>

A picture of a drink, an artistic creation,
But before you upload, let's have some clarification.
No strong spirits, no scenes that are illicit,
We uphold responsibility, so let's keep it exquisite. <br> <br>

Comments are welcome, but keep it polite,
Respect is crucial, don't be a sight for sore might.
A compliment, a recommendation, give it a thought,
To build a community where everyone feels sought. <br> <br>

Likes are sweet like sugar, spread them around,
But fake likes are like a sour drink, a taste without sound.
Give your like only if you truly feel it's right,
We seek genuine engagement, that's our delight. <br> <br>

So let's raise our glasses, with a click and a cheer,
Together we create a space, without any fear.
A world of drinks, of colors and tastes,
With respect and love, we never go to waste. <br> <br>

Welcome to our site, where drinks create magic,
Follow these rules, and let's all be ecstatic.
Come and share your drinks, let's build a story together,
For our community of drink lovers, our photo-sharing weather. <br>
